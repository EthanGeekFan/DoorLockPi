# Door Lock Pi

This is a project aimed at building a facial recognition door lock for my room. 


## Functionality

This door lock should recognize my face and automatically unlock the door to let me in. 

However, it should detect other people's faces and notify me that there are people at the door and I should decide whether to let them in.
